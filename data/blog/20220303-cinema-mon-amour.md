Good cinema explodes with life! Every shot, every frame, and every cut animates bytes of information or sheets of celluloid with unimaginable emotions. And as we near the completion of one year of venturing into the universe of films, we thought it appropriate to get a perspective about the world of filmmaking itself. **In this curation we journey through the various ways cinema has shaped us.**

We start **Week 1** off with Federico Fellini's eternal classic - *8 1/2*, in an attempt to investigate the struggles of a filmmaker running through a dry spell. The internal struggles inherent in creative filmmaking and a filmmaker's hunt for personal inspirations gives us a glimpse into the treacherous paths directors take to put forward a piece of their life in front of us.

In **Week 2**, we take a look at a cinephile struggling to sustain a cinematheque under financially stressful conditions, in *A Useful Life (La Vida Ãºtil)* by Federico Veiroj. This film may come as a reflection of our own struggles, as cinephiles, in the ruins of a once-great film society. Set in reflection of real events concerning a cinematheque in Uruguay, we will come to see that the pain of a film lover is, without question, universal.

As we move towards **Week 3**, we will return to the world of filmmaking, and the passion it ignites in us. We start the week with Girish Kasaravalli's *Gulabi Talkies*, taking us through the life of another gentle and passionate film lover, Gulabi, who lives in a communally divided sleepy town of Kundapura. The story takes on a course when Gulabi is gifted with a colour TV with an antenna.

Next, we look at another film that is also a love letter to Cinema with *Caro Diario (Dear Diary)* by Nanni Moretti presenting us with three anthological episodes of his life imprinted on cinema.

Finally, on **Week 5**, we take a look at cinema on a grander scale - as an industry. Here, we look at Christopher Guest's *The Big Picture*. The story of a filmmaker in Hollywood who has his early success induced ego bludgeoned away as he gets his glimpse of the brutal world of Hollywood. Despite the cultural differences, some of the implications of the film, as we shall see, become brutally axiomatic.

On that note, we wish you all a Happy 1 Year Anniversary!

Thank you for being with us. We will see you all for many more years to come...
