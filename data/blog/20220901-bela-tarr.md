It wasn’t long ago when the Hungarian filmmaker Béla Tarr was interviewed by Indiewire. When asked if his monolithic film (Satantango, 1994) would resonate decades later, he responded “Who gives a fuck? I’m not prophetic. I was just an ugly, poor filmmaker and I still am. I don’t have power or anything, just a camera.” Such is the frustration and anguish that roots his films. As Tarr’s initial interests aligned with the “Budapest school” approach popular in Hungary at the time for depicting social realism, he started his works on what he terms “social cinema”. He would then soon progress to have one of the most singular voices in the history of film. Often associated with capturing the lower class of Hungary against the grimy environments with a cold and gloomy atmosphere, only Tarr’s form and narratives could supplement and perhaps contend Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky in the misery expressed by his world and those who inhabit it.
