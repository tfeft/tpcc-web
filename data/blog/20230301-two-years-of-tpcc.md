When we started meagerly, in 2021, with Gravity by Alfonso Cauron and 2001: A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick, little did we expect a benign Reddit post to fulminate into a serious film club with the members encouraging us to curate films that not only challenge their own boundaries of cinema, but also win them over emotionally. Simultaneously, the drive to resurface films that are widely unknown, and the impulse to have enriching conversations around prominent filmmakers and their films, have constantly pushed the film club to dare to push towards more and more unconventional cinema.

Over the course of these two years, we have had a total of 140 films screened (online, in-person, or both), and have had lively discussions about them. We have also had eminent filmmakers like Girish Kasaravalli, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Jayaraj, Babu Subramaniam, MK Raghavendra and Nandita Das join these discussions and share their wisdom on not only their own films, but also about their connection to cinema and the general state of the film industry. We believe these screenings and discussions not only introduce good cinema to the members, but also breeds and blooms a film culture that prioritizes important and wonderful films, while also inspiring filmmakers to cater to this maturity.

We would like to thank Mr. B Suresh, Mr. Girish Kasaravalli, and Mr. Shashidhara for their immense support during the genesis of the club. It is their unwavering support that has helped us walk so far, and it is their wisdom that gives us the courage to see a future.
We would also like to thank all the volunteers who have been with us so far.
A special thank-you to Varun Ramesh, who helped found the club, who had been - and continues to be - relentless in working for it.
A heartfelt thank-you to Vivek, who essentially built the club from the ground up, and curated some of the best films in the line-ups.
An earnest thank-you to Altaf, who helped shape the administration of the film club in its inaugural days.
Finally, a warm thank-you to all the members for keeping this dream alive.

The club would not function without our admins and volunteers:

- Sharanya (supervisor, designer)
- Jeffrey (tech, designer, moderator)

A special mention to our regular members Tara, Druid, Krishna Prabha, Paprika, Chin DS, Rakesh, Mohammad, Kaivalya, Sanjay, Samraj, Samartha and Supreeth for helping enrich the club's events and discussions with their presence and inputs.
