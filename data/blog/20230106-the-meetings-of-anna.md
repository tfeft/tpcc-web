It might seem Akerman was building, both formally and thematically, to *The Meetings of Anna* after her previous works, two feature lengths, shorts and a documentary in conventional terms but for a filmmaker to whom everything just blends into one another, some kind of semi-autobiographical work would not seem like a stretch, which is what this film has been long considered.

The cold and calculated distance she employs with muted colors, static and truck shots making for a tangible rhythm are all now part of her language at this point in her career. The opening shot alone, of a woman in transit, at the German 'Bahnhof' immediately conveys the feeling of being alien to the surroundings.

Granted, the audience learns of the woman’s Brussels origin later, but that’s also exactly why the shot works on such a personal level to Akerman, the artist, herself, and not meant for the audience in its entirety at that moment. In that way, personal filmmaking is not new to Akerman at all, also considering she is, after all, a filmmaker who starred herself in her first major work (*Je, Tu, Il, Elle*).

Akerman rarely captures the eventful as she is more interested in the negation of it with the titular meetings being closest to 'events' as she orchestrates mundanity through her editing pattern with perpendicular movements of people, the sound of footsteps and surroundings and her characters talking of post-war society, recession, loneliness and what happiness means for a woman recurrently.

Aurora Clément who plays Anna lets out a subtle smile when her mother, while talking about her father, says “He turns his gaze inward, seeing god knows what” and that perhaps is, implicitly, key to Akerman’s work and personality. With a progressive stance on femininity, sexuality and filmmaking, what would one find looking inward? That is about as precise as one gets to Akerman’s artistic core.
